IDE Setup (Windows):

1. Create an main Folder (in the following MESC_Project Folder)

2. Clone this repository in the MESC Projekt Folder

Now you should have the following file structure:

- MESC_Project
	- MESC_Fimrware
		- MESC_COMMON
		- â€¦
3. Create an STM32Cube ide Workspace in the MESC_Project Folder

4. Create your own STM32 Project in MESC_Firmware

5. Resolve the includes - your project must point to ../MESC_Common/Inc in Properties ->C/C++ General->Paths and symbols

If you Hardware uses an STM32 MCU not part of the STM32F series, create an header file called stm32fxxx_hal.h and include inside that haeder the equivalent file for you MCU series
