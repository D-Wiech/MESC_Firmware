## Licence
This project will initially (and perhaps perpetually) contain a lot of firmware licenced under the STM Cube licence, BSD 3 clause https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause. The rest of the custom code is intended to be contained primarily in the MESC files, also BSD 3 Clause. It is requested that if you borrow, port, refactor parts into your own code... etc this firmware, you may let the project owner know, But you are not compelled to.  It would also be nice if concise and focused improvements were contributed back, but again, you are not compelled to.

You must retain credit for the code origin in your source, even on small segments borrowed or reimplemented. This is compelled. If this code is borrowed in part or whole for use and published in GPLV2 V3... projects, you must grant a perpetual licence for your projects GPL code to be used permissively in this project reciprocally. Otherwise, for commercial and permissively licenced projects, the code can be used as BSD-3-Clause. The intention of this project is to be useful to whoever wants to use, learn, build, sell... with the freedom to lock down the code and make it safe.
