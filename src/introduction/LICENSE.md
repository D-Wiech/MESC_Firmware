# MESC_Firmware

## Licence
This project will initially (and perhaps perpetually) contain a lot of firmware licenced under the STM Cube licence, BSD 3 clause https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause .   
The rest of the custom code is intended to be contained primarily in the MESC files, also BSD 3 Clause.
It is requested that if you borrow, port, refactor parts into your own code... etc this firmware, you may let the project owner know, But you are not compelled to. 
It would also be nice if concise and focused improvements were contributed back, but again, you are not compelled to.

You must retain credit for the code origin in your source, even on small segments borrowed or reimplemented. This is compelled.

If this code is borrowed in part or whole for use and published in GPLV2 V3... projects, you must ensure that the origin of the code is clear and that it is clear that there is no GPL obligation of the relevant sections to avoid any ambiguity or claims of GPL infringement.
Bugfixes or "improvements on the theme" made by GPL projects should be allowed to be back ported to this project as BSD-3-Clause. 
None of the above statements shall be construed as modifying the licence of another project's original work. The intent is purely to avoid a situation where use in multiple projects causes concern about integration into proprietary code, or further development around similar themes might give rise to infringement concerns.

The above is to protect the ability/right for this code to be used in closed source or proprietary systems; as segments already have been.
For commercial, closed source and permissively licenced projects, the code can be used as BSD-3-Clause. The intention of this project is to be useful to whoever wants to use, learn, build, integrate, sell or even lock down a version for regulatory compliance purposes.
