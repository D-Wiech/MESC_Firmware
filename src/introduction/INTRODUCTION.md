# Documentation for MESC_Firmware

Custom FOC, speed control firmware originally for use with the MESC_FOC_ESC hardware project. 

Now ported to work on typical F405 based hardware (e.g. VESC, FSESC, custom boards...)
Also ported to work on L431RC and F401CC (Blackpill). 
Other STM32 ports are easy to do, and perhaps other MCU vendors.
