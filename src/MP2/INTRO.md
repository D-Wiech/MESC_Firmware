# MESC Reference ESC: The Multi-Platform, Modular, Powerful (MP2) Speed Control

The MP2 Features
* Relatively compact design, fitting for ebikes / medium-large electric scooters.
* Inexpensive, optimized for low cost assembly by JLCPCB
* 100-300A operation with 18 FET, bus bars, and cooling
* Modular, with easily replaceable modules 
* Compatible with several open source projects including VESC, EBICS, SmartESC, STM32 Motor Control Workbench and MESC
